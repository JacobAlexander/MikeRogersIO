<p>I recently spent a month backpacking around western Europe. I didn't want to take my MacBook Pro with me (The kerfuffle with insurance if it was stolen outweighed my need for it), so my main source of information was my <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/smartphones/htc-desire-s/">HTC Desire S</a>. Here are a few notes on stuff I found was useful.</p>

<h2>1. Improving battery life</h2>
<p>One of the main let downs with Android is the crapware networks &amp; manufactures put on the handset (in most cases you can't even uninstall it). So I rooted my phone &amp; put <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> on it. Removing the unused apps gave me about 25% more battery per day.</p>

<p>I also put my phone in Airplane mode when I wasn't using it. I found having my phone in airplane mode used about 1/20 of the battery it would have if I didn't have airplane mode on.</p>

<h2>2. Improve security</h2>
<p>I was fairly paranoid about losing my phone, or my data while I was away. Here are a three apps &amp; one technique I used to keep myself a little safer.</p>

<h3>Prey</h3>
<p><a href="http://preyproject.com/">Prey</a> lets you keep track of your stolen device via a web interface &amp; in some cases you can take pictures of the people who have taken it. It's also free, so this seemed like a no brainer.</p>

<h3>SugarSync</h3>
<p>I didn't want to lose my photos, so I set up <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/referral?rf=bvzwfmawhdkjh&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=referral&amp;shareEvent=1204296">SugarSync</a> to backup the photos I took while I was away, so if I did lose my phone, my photos will still be ok. It also meant that when I was home, my Mac had the photos I had taken already on it ready for me to sort through.</p>

<h3>Set DNS</h3>
<p>I used a a few shared wireless hotspots, quite a few of these offered some pretty interesting DNS servers. So I used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.mytechie.setDNS&amp;hl=en">Set DNS</a> for rooted android phones to change the DNS servers to the one offered by Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4).</p>

<h3>VPN</h3>
<p>I also used a private VPN while I was traveling mostly because I wanted to keep my data secure from anyone listening over wifi or mobile network connections. If you have a VPS, you can install <a href="http://blog.ninjahideout.com/posts/osx-ubuntu-and-openvpn-in-5-minutes">OpenVPN</a> pretty easily (though make sure your VPS provider is ok about it).</p>

<h2>3. Finding my way around</h2>
<p>Before I went away, I was given a couple of books to help find my way about. However, carrying a big book around a city during the day seemed a little silly. Here are a few apps I used to help find my way around.</p>

<h3>Google maps</h3>
<p>Google maps was pretty handy to find my way around town, I also found it was pretty handy to make "My Places" map in google maps  to save a few useful locations (Like my hostel &amp; cool things to do during the day). That said, google maps didn't cache the maps I made, so I had to keep downloading them every time I wanted to check it.</p>

<h3>TripAdvisor &amp; Lonely Planet</h3>
<p>I found the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=TripAdvisor">TripAdvisor</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Lonely+Planet,+Inc.">Lonely Planet</a> app guides really useful, they listed the top things to do &amp; all the data it needed (about 32mb per city) was downloaded on wifi so it didn't eat to much data.</p>

<h3>FourSquare</h3>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joelapenna.foursquared">FourSquare</a> was really handy for finding awesome places around the cities, though reading the reviews &amp; checking in ate lots of data.</p>

<h2>4. Dealing with data</h2>
<p>Even with lower data roaming prices within Europe, the price of sending the odd tweet or checking google maps was silly. So I picked up a prepaid data sim (it's pretty easy to walk into a phone shop and ask for one, they should only cost a few euros for 1GB data) and used a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005SV2H9I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005SV2H9I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fulondes-21">Micro Sim Adaptor</a> to make it work with my phone.</p>

<p>In most cities the signal was pretty awesome, I could download at about 100kb/s. That said, you may want to look into a picking up a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005KLOLM2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005KLOLM2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fulondes-21">unlocked MiFi</a> to get more out of your SIM.</p>

<h2>5. Making calls on the cheap</h2>
<p>Calling &amp; texting while traveling looked friggin expensive! However with the data sim I had &amp; jumping onto free wifi, I used <a href="http://www.viber.com/">Viber</a> (It's like Skype, but not a bloated OTT POS) to make calls &amp; message people.</p>
