<p><a title="Wufoo" href="http://wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a> is a great service which makes managing forms on a website pretty simple, unfortunately their font selection is fairly limited. Luckily there is a really quick way to get better fonts on Wufoo.</p>

<p>Firstly, create a Wufoo theme with a custom CSS file. You can achieve this by clicking "Themes" in the tabbed navigation, than selecting "Advanced" in the property select box and than putting a URL to a CSS file to which you have access to. Than click "Save Theme" &amp; giving it a rememberable name.</p>

<p>Next find the font you want to use on <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a>, than click "Quick-use" than select the "@import" tab to receive the code to put into your CSS sheet. The @import CSS rule will be used to download the extra font.</p>

<p>Put the code provided by Google Web Fonts into the top of your CSS file and voila, you can start using the font you selected on Wufoo forms.</p>
