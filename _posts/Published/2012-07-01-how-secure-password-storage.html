Over a year ago I wrote a article on hashing passwords, since than the technique I used have deprecated. If your using PHP, here is a much better way of hashing your users passwords. I've also sprinkled comments within the code which i will explain a little better after.

[code here]

<h2>Salting the password</h2>

Salting a passwords makes it a little harder to decrypt the hashed version of a password, the way it works is your pretty much adding more data to a users password making it less likely to appear in a rainbow table. For example, the password "123456" is fairly likely to be in a rainbow table, but the salted version "123456webfjdirifnskrodmwjrmfkdiejtmfndkiojreoijviojwfeoijregiojvoidjg" is less likely to be in a rainbow table.

<h2>Multiple hash passes</h2>

The more passes you make, the longer it takes someone to unhash your passwords. It's recommended you make as many passes as possible without hurting your performance too much. I made the code I wrote year based, so if the user last updated their password in 2012 they will have more passes than a user who last updated in 2005. 

<h2>Ditching MD5</h2>

I first started using MD5 back in 2005, so it's no surprise it's not considered a top notch hashing method. Your better using the one I used. Try updating your hashing method based on the year, that way your for the most part very up to date.
