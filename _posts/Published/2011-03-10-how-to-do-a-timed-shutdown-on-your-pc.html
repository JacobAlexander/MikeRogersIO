Recently I've stumbled upon a really neat technique to listening to <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> while I'm heading off to bed, then not have to get up to turn my music off once I'm dropping off.

Firstly, set up a playlist in Spotify which will help you relax. Once you have done this step, open up command line (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true">cmd.exe</a>) and type the following:

<!--more-->

[gist id="2942065" file="shutdown.bat"]

<h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
The above command will shutdown your PC in 900 seconds. Let me quickly break down how this command works:
<ul>
	<li><em>shutdown</em> indicates you want to run <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491003.aspx">shutdown.exe</a></li>
	<li><em>-s</em> is a flag saying you want to shutdown your PC</li>
	<li><em>-f</em> is a flag stating you want to force shutdown, so your PC will not hang around waiting for applications to close while shutting down</li>
	<li><em>-t</em> is a flag which indicates you want a timed shutdown</li>
	<li><em>900</em> means the amount of seconds until the shutdown occurs. In this case 900 seconds, or 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
Once this is command has been run you should see an information bubble (Like below) stating when the shutdown will occur.

<h2>How to abort</h2>
You may also want to abort your shutdown, in that case just put the following code into your command line:

[gist id="2942065" file="cancel-shutdown.bat"]

The <em>-a</em> flag stands for "Abort a system shutdown".
