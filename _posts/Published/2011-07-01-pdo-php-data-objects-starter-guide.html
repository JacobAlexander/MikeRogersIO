<p>It may surprise you to hear, that using the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php">mysql_connect()</a> function in PHP has recently be marked as "old hat" coding because it's slow in comparison with newer methods. A better alternative is <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php">PDO (PHP Data Objects)</a>, a lightweight method for accessing databases. Here is a quick overview to help you get started with PDO.</p>

<h2>Reasons to use PDO</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's Fast - it talks to the database via a database specific PDO-driver.</li>
	<li>It's Object Oriented - The methods within the class are the same for each database driver, so you can easily change your database driver without lots of extra coding.</li>
	<li>It's Flexible-  You can easily change between such database drivers as PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite by pretty much just changing your construct statement.</li>
	<li>It's Safer - PDO encourages you to bind parameters to your SQL query's, meaning that it's significantly less likely your website will suffer from a SQL injection based attack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connecting to a Database</h2>
<p>Connecting to a database is pretty simple. Here is how to connect to a MySQL Database.</p>

<h2>Doing A Query</h2>
<p>Again, doing a query is just as simple as:</p>

{% gist 2941987 query.php %}

<p>However, if you are using user variables which may cause a SQL Injection you should bind the parameter to the query (see next example).</p>

<h2>Binding a parameter to a query</h2>
{% gist 2941987 binding.php %}

<p>If you bind a parameter to a request, it will sterilize the input so that it will not cause a SQL Injection.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
