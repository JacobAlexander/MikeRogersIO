<p>Here is a really nifty trick I've been using for a while to decrease the time a page takes to load. Add the following lines of code to your .htaccess file:</p>

{% gist 2907558 %}

<p>This quick and easy method tells the user to cache files which are unlikely to change for 10 years (feel free to change the amount of time) and HTML for 1 second. It also turns off eTags.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I also added a another piece of code I use which turns on Gzip, which reduces the amount of bandwidth required to transfer a file.</p>
