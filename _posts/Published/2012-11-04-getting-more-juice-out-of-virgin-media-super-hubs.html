<p>I've recently moved to my ISP over to Virgin Media, the download speed is pretty decent but the no-so-super hub they provide is pants. The super hub has terrible signal strength (standing 8m away from it lead to a 50% drop in download speed) &amp; it regularly dropped out.</p>

<p>The only solution I could find online to get decent signal was to change the super hub into Modem Mode than attach a decent router. I decided on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002YETVTQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002YETVTQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fulondes-21">TP-Link TL-WR1043ND</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=fulondes-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B002YETVTQ" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> from Amazon (It's was £43 or so) &amp; now my signal is almost 95% at the other side of my house with very little noticeable speed loss. If your on Virgin Media &amp; have a spare £40 you should give it a try. Below is a picture of my setup.</p>
