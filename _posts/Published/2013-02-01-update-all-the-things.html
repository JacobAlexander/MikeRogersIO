<p>I finally found a bit of time to update a few of my Wordpress plugins, here is a quick summary of the changes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/socialize-this/">Socialize This</a> - This is one of my oldest plugins, the update from 2.2.4 to 2.3.0 is mostly just a clean up of unnecessary UI linkage. Hopefully I should have version 3 finish by the summer (It'll mostly be a recode from top to bottom).</li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-html5-category-selector/">WP HTML5 Category Selector</a> - I removed a load of unnecessary code from the plugin &amp; the clear button. It now makes use of the search input type.</li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gist-shortcode/">Gist Shortcode</a> - I've been using this on my site for a while now, I decided it was finally worth sharing you everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main changes for all the above plugins is that I'm going to try &amp; use their GitHub repos as the main issue tracker &amp; develop them a bit more often.</p>
