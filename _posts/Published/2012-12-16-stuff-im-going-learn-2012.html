<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter bootstrap</a> has really grown on me in the last few months, while I still code front end sites with a "keep it as small as possible" approach, the efficiency gained when using bootstrap is awesome.</p>

<h2>PHP Frameworks</h2>
<p>I finally started getting into using frameworks this year (Once I got my head around MVC they started clicking more &amp; more). <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii</a> has been one of the frameworks I thought was pretty cool (mostly because you can build a site based on the database set up).</p>

<p>I reckon this year I'm going to move more towards <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend</a> &amp; <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">FuelPHP</a> (maybe <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> too).</p>

<h2>SASS/LESS</h2>
<p>I've really taken to using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> in most my projects this year, though I've been using it with <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> on my Mac which feels messy. I'm looking at setting up my stack so it just complies on the server on the fly &amp; caches on a CDN.</p>

<h2>Node.JS</h2>
<p>I've played a little with Node.js, it's on my todo to use it more.</p>

<h2>iTunes U</h2>
<p>I love kicking back &amp; watching videos on my iPad. I'm going to try and make use of some of the videos on iTunes U this year.</p>

<h2>More Linux</h2>
<p>I'm currently on OSX, which is nice but too many of the updates cause issues. I'm pretty tempted to make Linux Mint/Pear OS my default OS.</p>
