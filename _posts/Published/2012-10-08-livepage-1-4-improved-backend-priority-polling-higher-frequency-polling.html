<p>I've finally found some time to work on LivePage and implement a few improvements. The new version isn't a big change visually, but backend wise it's mostly been rewritten.</p>

<p>You can download the most recent LivePage from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh">the Chrome web store</a> (free of course).</p>

<h2>Backend rewrite</h2>
<p>The previous engine was written over a rainy weekend, which meant the code became a little unmanageable over time. One of the main changes was rewriting the backend with a strong Object Oriented focus, as a result the code is much more manageable &amp; has decent comments.</p>

<h2>Priority polling</h2>
<p>LivePage now polls the file which previously updated more frequently, so if your working on a single css file you should see what you save quicker.</p>

<h2>Higher frequency polling</h2>
<p>The new engine has more efficient code, as a resource on a pages resources can be polled at much higher rate (In a test, I managed to about 1500 polls per minute on the fastest (25ms) setting). As a result of this, I tweaked the default polling rate to 200ms from 750ms and changed the option list to a range field in the options page.</p>
