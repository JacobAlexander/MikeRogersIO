<p>I love my HTC Desire S to bits, but in general surfing the web has recently become a total pain. I keep coming across large websites who appear to have not even looked at their site on a mobile.</p>

<h2>Failing to show content</h2>
<p>An old SEO trick which has always survived is "Content is king", meaning if a user can't find what they want on a website, they will promptly leave. Several news sites force me onto the mobile version of their site, just to display a header &amp; footer but not the content I came to read.</p>

<p>All this is doing is making me think your site is junk &amp; worth blocking from my google results.</p>

<h2>Inconsistant links</h2>
<p>I tend to read articles from Reddit, Twitter on my phone &amp; reshare them. Nothing is worse than having a redirect from yoursite.com to m.yoursite.com (Benchmark it! Over mobile internet that redirect can take a while), than for me to share that link to a desktop user who gets a crap experience.</p>

<h2>Dirty Redirects</h2>
<p>Using a javascript based redirect for android users is pretty much like stabbing them in the face with a fork. The problem is, if they press the back button they go back to the page which redirects them. As a result, they will think your site is a buggy POS which isn't worth exploring.</p>

<p>Instead use a mobile first, responsive web design approach to your website. That way, you can send users a mobile friendly site &amp; have a single sane URL. A better solution is sending a 301 redirect in the headers.</p>

<h2>Asking me to use their app</h2>
<p>I just love it when a site asks me to download their app (especially if I came from the site from a search engine or a bookmark site) for before I can see the site itself. Seriously, stop doing that crap! A banner inline on your site should suffice.</p>

<h2>Forgetting about branding</h2>
<p>Using a generic theme like WPTouch on your wordpress blog without any branding is lazy and makes your site forgettable. Instead, just spend a few minutes adding you logo and colour plate in.</p>
