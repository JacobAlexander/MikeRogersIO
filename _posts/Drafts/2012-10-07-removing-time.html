<p>A few weeks ago I was pointed towards a post by <a href="http://stevecorona.com/living-without-time">Steve Corona</a> where he discussed living without time. I found the idea pretty interesting, so decided to give it a try while working on a few project sprints.</p>

<h2>Removing time</h2>
<p>Avoiding time was damn hard.</p>

<p>I normally work on a Mac, so I found a neat little app called <a title="Mac Bartender" href="http://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> which hides items from your menu bar.  It's really good, I removed a bunch of items from my bar which I either didn't care for or could tell me the time. Here is my current menu bar:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2458" title="My menu bar" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2012/10/my-toolbar.png" alt="Empty menu bar" width="243" height="22" /></p>

<p>My phone is my primary timepiece (I don't own a watch), so it seemed like it would make sense to remove the clock from the lock screen. Unfortunately I couldn't find any decent apps, instead I just switched my phone to no-vibrate mode &amp; left it facing down for my work session.</p>

<p>The last thing I changed was my music. I was pretty sure I would notice the gaps between songs &amp; use them as a point of reference. To avoid this I increase the crossfade on my music to 5 seconds &amp; put on a trance playlist.</p>

<h2>First sprint</h2>
<p>One of the first things I noticed when I removed clocks from a coding session, was how much easier it was to focus on a task in hand. I'm not sure why, but the amount of time I procrastinated on reddit/Hacker news decreased a little.</p>

<p>Losing my time reference is fun.</p>
