Ok, it's totally ok to use it, but maybe consider using a bower managed system...this might be a shit post.

## Use the CDN

https://github.com/ai/jquery-cdn - We can serve it via a CDN, so why don't we?

## Or bower

Bower updates as soon as jQuery release a new version, so it does no rely on https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails being updated. 

You can even get around it with https://rails-assets.org/
