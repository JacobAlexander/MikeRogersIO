here are a handful of habits which are useful to have.

1. Using PDO or mysqli_* instead of mysql_*

The MySQL extension is being softly depreciated as of PHP 5.4, so it's a good time to get into the habit of using better PHP extensions such as PDO or MySQLi.

2. Commenting your code

Commenting on your code is really important, as a rule of thumb if you have to think about it you should put a brief explanation of what is going on.

3. Backing up your work

It sucks when you lose your stuff, I sync all my work via dropbox.

4. Sharing your work

Share you work, other people may look at it and point out areas for improvement. Or even better, you may show someone else a better way of doing stuff.

5. Expanding you skill set

Attend conferences, or just having a geeky talk with a college or friend.
