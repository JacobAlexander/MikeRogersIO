## Main focus
Most my traffic is people looking at code I've chucked up quickly from search engines, I'm going to aim for super fast load times over to much frill.

That said, my current homepage sucks. I'm going to try and make it show off more of the project I've been working on.

## A projects section
If there is time, I'll a short writeup on some of the new stuff (I still need to make stuff lol)
