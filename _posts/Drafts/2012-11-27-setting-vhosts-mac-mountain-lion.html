Here is a short tutorial of how to develop websites locally on Mountain Lion. I'm going to use Macs built in Apache &amp; I'm not going to install MySQL in this article.
<h2>Before you start</h2>
You're going to need a few apps on your mac before you can get started.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> - This is a great text editor for changing your configuration files on your system &amp; other files. Make sure you download it from their website, the version from the App Store dosen't let you edit system files.</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmask/">Gas Mask</a> - This lets your easily edit your hosts file so you can point domains such as yoursite.local to your local machine.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> -  This is a handy tool which lets you easily manage MySQL databases.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Showing hidden files</h2>
If you're developing sites odds are you will need to see hidden files &amp; folders in Finder. The simplest way to do this  is to open finder &amp; run the following command.

[gist id="4141692"]

A more in-depth explication on what this does can be found on <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58709/how-to-view-hidden-files-in-finder">StackOverflow</a>.

<h2>Turning on Virtual Hosts</h2>
Navigate in finder to<em> /private/etc/apache2</em>, you can do this quickly by clicking Go &gt; Go To Folder in the menu bar. Find the file called <em>httpd.conf </em>and than navigate to the line (around 476):

[gist id="4141706" file="vhosts-off.sh"]

than replace it with

[gist id="4141706" file="vhosts-on.sh"]

<h2>Turn on PHP</h2>
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

<h2>Set up PHPs configuration</h2>
php.ini.default > php.ini in /etc

<h2>Correct the Virtual Hosts permissions</h2>
By default Mac dosen't like their built in Apache accessing your Sites folders. To fix it navigate to <em>/private/etc/apache2/extra,</em> open the file <em>httpd-vhosts.conf</em> and add the following to the top of your file:

[gist id="4141733"]

Change <Your-Username> with your mac username. You can read up on this snippet of code on <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57481978-263/how-to-enable-web-sharing-in-os-x-mountain-lion/">CNET</a>.

<h2>Adding your Virtual Hosts in</h2>

Ok, navigate to <em>/private/etc/apache2/extra,</em> open the file <em>httpd-vhosts.conf</em> again. At the bottom of the file for each site add the following:

[gist id="4141749" file="httpd-vhosts-example.conf"]

Next open up Gas Mask &amp; add the following to the <em>127.0.0.1</em> rule:

[gist id="4141749" file="hosts"]

Make sure that you add the server names on the same line as <em>127.0.0.1</em> with a tab between each entry, otherwise you may find your Mac getting a tad slow when querying locally.

<h2>Restarting Apache &amp; starting the party</h2>
sudo apachectl restart
