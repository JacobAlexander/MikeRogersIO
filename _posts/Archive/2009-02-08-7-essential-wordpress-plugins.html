<p>Wordpress is fantastic, one of its main strengths is it’s expandability. Wordpress has thousands of plugins, however most of these plugins are a big waste of disc space. Here are some actually useful plugins for wordpress.</p>

<p><a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a>
One of the most essentially plugins you will ever need on wordpress, this plugin decreases load per page (by caching the content) which improves your websites performance and can lower server costs. This plugin is especially nessessary if your blog is running on a low quality server or you receive high volumes of traffic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.laptoptips.ca/projects/tinymce-advanced/" target="_blank">TinyMCE Advanced</a>
TinyMCE is the editor used in wordpress, however in wordpress it has been set up lacking quite a few features. This plugin lets you add more features to the editior.</p>

<p><a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a>
Spam comments are a real pain in wordpress, however this plugin sifts through your comments looking for spam. This can keep your blog on tip-top condition which should improve your rankings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-home/" target="_blank">Google XML Sitemaps</a>
XML sitemaps are very important when it comes to SEO, however creating them and keeping them up-to-date is a hassle. This plugin keeps your sitemap up-to-date.</p>

<p><a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/sociable/" target="_blank">Sociable</a>
Everyone like sharing (especially when it generates you more traffic), this plugin adds links to digg, delicious and other social sharing websites at the bottom of your posts (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.irisco.it/forum.php?id=1" target="_blank">StatPress</a>
Any good webmaster will tell you that ‘Knowing your visitors is useful’, this plugin analyses where your clients comes from and also generates pretty graphs.</p>

<p><a href="http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-12-release.html" target="_blank">Wordpress Automatic Upgrade</a>
This is one of these plugins which is more of a time saver, then a essential. But if your anything like me (too lazy to spend 2 minutes updating some files) this plugin will be a life saver.</p>
