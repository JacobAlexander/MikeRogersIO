<p>Innovation of the week is were I share some of the really innovative designs, coding or ideas which are new to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Bore Me Lunchtime Shuffle - </strong><a href="http://www.boreme.com/">View</a></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="untitled-3" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/02/untitled-3.png" alt="untitled-3" width="202" height="188" /></p>

<p>Between 12pm and 2.30pm Bore Me plays 5 videos back to back, so you can sit back and eat your lunch while having a giggle. However, it only works around lunchtime (unless you change your computers clock). If they added a "It's not lunch, but show anyway" button it would be a lot better.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation Rating:</strong> 3/5 <br>
A great idea, design and execution lets it down.</p>
