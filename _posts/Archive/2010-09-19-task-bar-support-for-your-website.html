Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) Beta was recently launched and in it was a really neat feature to allow users to pin your website onto the task bar. Here are a few tips to make sure your website makes the most of feature.</p>
<h2>Make the most of your Favicons</h2>
<p>Make sure you have a high quality transparent Favicon, if you don't then your website logo will look small and out of place while on a users taskbar. If you don't have one to hand, use <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/">favicon.cc</a> to build one. I suggest making one which is 64px x 64px (but feel free to go up to 128px) so your icon does not look pixelated in the task bar.</p>

<h2>Set a Default Name and URL</h2>
<p>It's handy to point your users to your website start page so here is the code you need to add to the head of your HTML page:</p>

[gist id="2941814" file="default-meta.html"]

<h2>Add Tasks</h2>
<p>If your website is split into very definite sections you may find it worthwhile to split add tasks to your jump list. Here is the code you need to add:</p>

[gist id="2941814" file="add-task.html"]

<p>You can add as many tasks as you like. You can find more information on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg131029(VS.85).aspx">Pinned Site over at MSDN</a>.</p>
