<p>2009 has been a somewhat interesting year for the internet; it's become more mobile &amp; more user friendly. However here are a few ideas I have had over the year, which I would like to see arrive in 2010.</p>
<h2>Video Stream Caching</h2>
<p>One of the big annoyances I have with streaming video files (normally on websites such as YouTube &amp; Megavideo) is whenever I go to jump to another section of the video I lose what I currently have already loaded. It would be really useful if I could quickly go back to the section I've previously loaded.</p>

 <em>This is a mock up I done, the video I used is from </em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKATXdRD4d0">RayWilliamJohnson</a></p>
<p>I'm quite sure this would need to be implemented by the software, but I can't see how it would be difficult to add.</p>

<h2>Facebook - Pop-up chat</h2>
<p>Pop-ups are a double edge sword; on the one hand they have been used incorrectly and become an utter annoyance. But on the other, they also can drastically improve a users experience with a website. For example the Facebook chat system is very inconvenient as I have to be looking at a Facebook page to talk to people. On a big screen this might not be a big issue, but on a small screen this makes it surprisingly difficult toÂ  multi-task.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_problem.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1258" title="facebook_chat_problem" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_problem.png" alt="facebook_chat_problem" width="597" height="445" /></a><em>Oh noes! I can't see the chat &amp; watch the video</em></p>
<p>However, if Facebook make the chat system as a desktop application or just available in a pop-up I suspect that would solve issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_popup_mockup.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1263 alignnone" title="facebook_chat_popup_mockup" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_popup_mockup.png" alt="facebook_chat_popup_mockup" width="251" height="376" /> </a><a href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_popup_mockup_button_on_fb.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1268 alignnone" title="facebook_chat_popup_mockup_button" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/12/facebook_chat_popup_mockup_button_on_fb.png" alt="facebook_chat_popup_mockup_button" width="237" height="315" /></a></p>
<h2>JavaScript Library Integrated into browsers</h2>
<p>It seems silly that I have to keep re-downloading the same file (A Javascript Library) to make a webpage more exciting. I would love to see not just jQuery, but most JavaScript libraries integrated into browsers (maybe as a add-on or something?) to speed up the download times of webpages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could be time to consider a new browser based language which is designed to make surfers &amp; developers lives easier. For example adding a new attribute to html forms which allowed for browser specific (so people with screen readers will not be disadvantaged) validation.</p>

<h2>OpenID/Facebook Connect - More widely adopted</h2>
<p>I hate having to sign up to websites, especially when I could just as easily use a login details from a single source. It would be really cool if more websites allowed for a "one click registration" option.</p>
<h2>Adobe Flash - Video Player Standardization</h2>
<p>One of my biggest pet hates is going onto a nice website just to find features I expect to find, or actions I believe are normal are just not present on the video players. For example I think it is normal for a click on a video to mean "pause" and a double click to go to full screen mode. I think this is just something Web Developers need to consider.</p>
