Here are a handful of some of the cool April Fools Days Pranks I saw today. Enjoy :)

<h2>Dr Peppers Chatroulette cheerleader prank</h2>
[video id="0zn7TeISq0k"]

This is why Dr Pepper is my soft drink of choice. It is by far the best April fool's day prank in this year.

<h2>xkcd switches to terminal</h2>

<a href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/xkcd_big.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1381" title="XKCD Terminal" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/xkcd_big-300x147.png" alt="XKCD Terminal" width="300" height="147" /></a>

The <a href="http://xkcd.com/">web comic xkcd</a> made quite a nifty terminal based website design.

<h2>Google UK's Translate for Animals</h2>

[video id="3I24bSteJpw"]

Google always goes all out for their April Fool's day jokes (In fact most of the Google product team's done something). This year, I think the UK translate team's was the most creative and that you can download the application on the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/landing/translateforanimals/">Google Translate for Animals website</a>.

<h2>Train Signal announces Windows 3.1 is the Future of Computing</h2>
[video id="rnkqmTmO_uc"]

The amount of time and effort that went into this video is crazy! Each time I've re-watched it I've noticed something new. It's defiantly worth a watch if you have creative block (or you want to see what Windows 3.1 looks like).

<h2>4chan adds Facebook Connect</h2>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1379" title="4chan facebook connect" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/4chan_facebook_connect.png" alt="4chan facebook connect" width="315" height="221" />

<a href="http://twitter.com/4chan/status/11409083836">4chan tweeted</a> that they are introducing 4chan 2.0 (beta), which now includes facebook connect.

<h2>Wikipedia's features "Wife Selling"</h2>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1380" title="wikipedia wife selling" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/wikipedia_wife_selling.png" alt="wikipedia wife selling" width="457" height="154" />

Wikipedia featured an article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_selling">Wife Selling</a>.

<h2>The Guardian reported about "Google Canoodle"</h2>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/leeds/2010/mar/31/leeds-google-canoodle-waterways-pilot-april-fool">The Guardian reported</a> that Google is mapping British water ways with a canoe. This strangely seems like quite a good idea.

<h2>Google Wave's Human Notifications</h2>
[video id="O8TkIJmLWFM"]

Google Wave <a href="http://wave.google.com/getwavewave.html">announced</a> you can now have Dr Wave, Ashton Kutcher or a Puppy notify you when you have a new wave.

<h2>The Independent - Hadron Collider planned for Circle Line</h2>
Lastly, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hadron-collider-ii-planned-for-circle-line-1932744.html">The Independent reported</a> that a Hadron Collider was planned for the Circle Line in the London Underground.
