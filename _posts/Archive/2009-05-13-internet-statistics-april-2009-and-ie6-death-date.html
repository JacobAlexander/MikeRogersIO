<p>Overall April was quite an eventful month for the OS and Browser wars. On the OS front, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/">Windows 7 (Win7) release candidate</a> was made available to the public, which has received quite a positive response. Microsoft also started advertising how cost effective windows machines are in their <a href="http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/">"I'm a PC"</a> advertisement campaign.</p>

<p>Browser wise, webmaster have been encouraged by Google to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sevenup/">inform their IE6 users</a> about the alternative browser available and the disadvantages of IE6. The effect this has had on IE6 users is debatable, but overall IE6 is slowly disappearing.</p>

<h2>Browser Statistics</h2>


<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862" title="april-09_browser-marketshare" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/april-09_browser-marketshare.png" alt="april-09_browser-marketshare" width="400" height="240" /><strong>Biggest Rise:</strong> IE8 (+2.13%)</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Fall: </strong>IE7 (-1.86%), closely followed by IE6 (-1.22%). IE7 and IE6 large drop in market share is mostly due to IE8 being released (so users are upgrading or switching).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-863" title="april-09_browser-marketshare_trend" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/april-09_browser-marketshare_trend.png" alt="april-09_browser-marketshare_trend" width="400" height="240" /></p>

<p>Next month I expect IE8's market share to increase as more IE7 users should start upgrading. IE6 should continue decreasing as a constant rate.</p>


<h2>OS Statistics</h2>


<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866" title="april-09_os-marketshare" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/april-09_os-marketshare.png" alt="april-09_os-marketshare" width="400" height="240" /></p>

<p><strong>Biggest Rise:</strong> Vista (+0.54%)<br />
 <strong>Biggest Fall: </strong>WinXP (-0.77%), lots of WinXP users are converting to Vista, Win7, Linux and Mac. However, WinXP is still a market leader.</p>

<p>Apple have recently started another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRcYS88BwQ">"Windows Sucks"</a> campaign, which criticizes Windows poor security which will affect the growth of Vista and WinXP. I'm expecting a 0.4% increase in Mac's on the market as a direct affect of this campaign.</p>

<p><a href="http://linux.com/">Linux</a> may be the underdog next month however; as recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqefSHEx7kE">user generated advertisement</a> (the best kind of advertisement) has been very positive, mostly putting empathises on Linux's Security and Performance. I expect a 0.5% growth.</p>


<h2>IE6 Death Date<a id="ie6_death_date" name="ie6_death_date"></a></h2>


<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864" title="april-09_ie6-death-graph" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/april-09_ie6-death-graph.png" alt="april-09_ie6-death-graph" width="452" height="262" /></p>

<p>Over the past few months I've been tracking the decline in IE6 market share. On average its current decrease is 0.9% a month, which works out about 0.02% a day. At its current rate, it should reach 0% market share on <em>13th October 2010 at around 9:36am</em>.</p>
