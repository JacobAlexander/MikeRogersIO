Here is a really easy check-list of how to deal with clients who don't pay for work.

<h2>Send them an email</h2>

Your clients are very busy people, luckily they tend to have email also. A polite reminder to their email should jog their memory. Here is an example template email:
<blockquote>Hey [Name],
I done some work [describe work] on [date] and I have not been paid yet ([amount]). Please could you look into it?
From,
[Contact Details]</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<h2>Call them</h2>

A Clients could have problems using computers (for example slow typing or poor vision), a phone call it a quick and easy way to remind them to send you money. Again, stay polite there could be a very fair reason for late payment.

<h2>Recoup your losses</h2>

If a client is still not paying up, it could be more worthwhile selling the work. Give the client a certain amount of time (such a 5 business days) and state they will lose all rights to the work and the work will be sold. Here is an example email/letter:
<blockquote>[Name],
I have called and messaged you over the last few days regarding [work]. You have failed to pay. You have 5 business days to pay or you will lose all rights to the work and I will recoup my losses.
From,
[Contact Details]</blockquote>
However, check your contact's obligations. You could need to wait a certain amount of time.

<h2>Consider legal action</h2>

If the work you have done is unique and you have a contract, you should consider legal action against the client. However, consult a lawyer before taking legal action.
