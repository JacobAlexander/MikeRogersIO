<p>Here are 5 things I hate to find when I visit a website.</p>


<h2>1. It only works in some browsers</h2>


<p>I'm a very keen Firefox fan, and I hate it when a website has been designed for IE and only IE. It's not hard to make a website work in the main 5 browsers (Chrome, Opera, Firefox, IE7, IE6 and Safari).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/partners/index.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814" title="oracle_31" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/oracle_31.png" alt="oracle_31" width="175" height="109" /></a><br />
 <em>Oracle PartnerNetwork's website uses JavaScript tabs for tabs, unfortunately in IE8 they don't work. </em></p>


<h2>2. Invalid HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>


<p>Nothing is worse than a website which just does not work; having invalid code can normally be the cause of most problems (For example, forgetting to close an element).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trinityconvergence.com%2F"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" title="trinityconvergence" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/trinityconvergence.png" alt="trinityconvergence" width="410" height="58" /></a><br />
 <em>Be sure to check your website with <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">The W3C Markup Validation Service</a> before you release your company's website.</em></p>

<h2>3. It needs JavaScript to work</h2>


<p>I like to have JavaScript disabled when I surf the web, mostly so I can save a few milliseconds per a page load (which really does add up over time). If you website is unable to work with JavaScript disabled, you seriously need to reconsidered how you have programmed your website.</p>


<h2>4. Ugly is an understatement for your design</h2>


<p>If you have poor contrast between the text on your page and the background colour you use, your instantly making your users eyes work extra hard to read your text.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ugadigital.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807" title="ugadigital" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/05/ugadigital.png" alt="ugadigital" width="329" height="109" /></a><br />
 <em>I would love to read more UGA Digital, but I white on a light colour (in this case, a whitish blue) is just silly.</em></p>


<h2>5. Your website lacks focus or a point in general</h2>


<p>Sometimes I get the feeling when I visit a website, that the person who created it started with an idea...then lost it at some point. Limit your website's products and features as too many will create too much choice for users (not to mention create an unnecessarily large navigation).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trinityconvergence.com/">Trinity Convergence</a> is a really good example of a webshite which really does "Miss the point".</p>

<p><em>Note: I almost put "Your Website is Unnecessary", and then I remembered I'm one of over 10,000 blogs regarding Web Design.</em></p>
