I recently was introduced to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004Z9B7I6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fulondes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z9B7I6">Through The Wormhole With Morgan Freeman</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004Z9B7I6" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> which I found profoundly interesting.

In a nutshell, it's Morgan Freeman guiding you questions such as "Is There a Creator?", "Is Time Travel Possible?" and "Are We Alone?" while giving you scientific theories to how/why certain phenomena is possible. 

While you can only buy season 1 on DVD via amazon right now (UK), season 2 can be purchased online and is also awesome. 

I highly recommend you give it a try :)
