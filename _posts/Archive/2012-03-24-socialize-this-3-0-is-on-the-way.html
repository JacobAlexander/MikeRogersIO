Good news everyone, the next version of Socialize This for Wordpress is currently being developed &amp; it's looking a lot better. Here are a few things I changed which should be noticeable to most users:

<h2>Rebuild code base</h2>
I first built socialise this 2 year ago, since then the core code provided by Wordpress has drastically improved. As a result lots of the code used in V2 of socialize this can be reduced from 100s of lines of code to a mere handful. Further more, my coding ability & Wordpress plugin best practises have improved dramatically. 

In the interest of providing users with a high efficiency plugin, I have decided to rebuild the plugin from scratch. 

<h2>More social network support</h2>
Since the first incarnation of socialize this, the only main social network integrated into the plugin was Twitter. This always bugged me, as it meant the plugin was really only being used for telling people about posts on twitter & it's ability to monitor how successful your social response is limited. In V3, I'm working hard to make socialize this more than just social buttons.

<h2>Custom post type support</h2>
One of the most sort after features within socialize this was support for custom post types, so I went ahead and added it. This than lead me to wonder how good the UX of the entire plugin was, which brings me nicely to my next point.

<h2>Completely overhauled UI</h2>
The UI was very much bolted on over time, this has lead to a very imperfect experience. The new structure of the plugin has been designed to make to make managing the social strategy of your blog as simple as possible. Little things like the naming of links in the administration panel have had serious amounts of thought put into them to make sure they are as logical as possible.
