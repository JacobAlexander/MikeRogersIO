<p>Google Chrome is well known for being very fast at rendering web pages, but based on an update on the <a href="http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/2010/05/chrome-and-browser-speed-tests-potato.html">Google Student Blog</a> it appears to be mind bogglingly snappy. To give you a sense of how snappy, take a look at this video comparing Chromes rendering to the speed to a potato.</p>

<p>Crazy Right? Well it's all down to a new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8 JavaScript rendering engine</a>, which boasts an improvement of 35%.</p>


<h2>That's great! What does it mean for Web Development?</h2>
<p>Hopefully this new engine will inspire other browser programmers how to render JavaScript faster, which in 3-6 months should mean the average user experience (the 35% of users who  upgrade their browser when updates are released) should be improved.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean we can use create complex JavaScript websites (Such as Facebook) render quickly, instead it means <a href="http://dzineblog.com/2008/03/10-websites-that-use-javascript-animation-effectively.html">subtle usability improvements</a> to a web page should be more effective.</p>
<p><em>Note: Is anyone interested in trying to recreate this but showing other browsers loading?</em></p>
