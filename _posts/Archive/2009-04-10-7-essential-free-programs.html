<p>Here are some free programs I consider essential for all PC's.</p>


<h2>1. CCleaner</h2>


<p>CCleaner is a freeware system optimization, privacy and cleaning tool. In a nutshell this deletes all the temporary files and rubbish that build up over time. It also is able to easily clear up the Windows Registry (Which after a few uninstalls or installs is worth a look).</p>

<h2>2. Firefox, Opera or Chrome</h2>


<p>Forget Internet Explorer, make your computer more unique (and possibly more secure) and take on a different browser. There are loads to close from, but personally I like Mozilla Firefox the most, as its open source nature means that it can be adapted and (if a bug appears) fixed very quickly.</p>

<h2>3. Tweak UI (A Microsoft Powertoy)</h2>


<p>Ever wanted to fix those little annoyances in Windows? Well Microsoft has a neat little application which lets you modify some of the hidden settings in windows.</p>

<h2>4. Recuva</h2>


<p>Ever lost a file and need to recover it? Or just make sure something has been securely deleted? This application does both.</p>

<h2>5. Smart Defrag</h2>


<p>One of the best Disk Defragmenter and Drive Optimization tools out there. I tested this program on a 700GB SATA hard drive (40% full) and within 20 minutes it had lowered fragmentation to 0.00% and reorganized my hard drive for faster loading time...Fantastic.</p>

<h2>6. Foxit Reader</h2>


<p>I have nothing against Adobes PDF reader, except it's sluggish and unnecessarily large. This free alternative is only a few MB and does basically the same thing. For just reading PDF's it's fantastic. I suggest you give it a try.</p>

<h2>7. K-Lite Codec Pack</h2>


<p>Save yourself hours of looking for various codec's and players to play audio and video. This essentially is all the codec's you need.</p>
