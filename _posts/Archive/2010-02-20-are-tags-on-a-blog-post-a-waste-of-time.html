<p>I recently received a question regarding why I have taken down the tags on my posts. The reason was because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96yDPqa2rs">watched a video from google (Also embedded below)</a> which made me wounder how much they are benefiting (and being used by) my users. After a brief test (I watched how many people were using the tag pages) I found that very few users actually were using them.</p>

[video id="A96yDPqa2rs"]

<p>The best way to summarize what I found would be:</p>

<p><em>For every 246 human users clicking a link on a page, 1 would be clicking a tag link.</em></p>
