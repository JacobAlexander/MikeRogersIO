<p>Internet Explorer 8 RC1 has just been released. You can download it <a title="IE 8 download page" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Internet-explorer/beta/default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Downloading/Installing</h2>
<p>At a miniature 16.2mb IE8 RC1 took me 30 seconds to download and it took in 9 minutes + 1 restart to get to my first web page.</p>

<p>It also imported my FireFox feeds and bookmarks, which was useful.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>I couldn't check what add-ons where available as the IE add-ons website was down (see screenshot). However, IE did open a nice tab showing some "accelerators" I could use (I think they are like google gears, but MS style).</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>Overall, IE8 seems faster than IE7 however compared to Opera, Firefox and Safari it's just does not feel as snappy. However in most speed test done by professionals it's a marginal difference, if you enjoy statistics take a look <a title="Beta Browser Speed Tests: Which Is Fastest?" href="http://lifehacker.com/5044668/beta-browser-speed-tests-which-is-fastest" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Backward Compatibility</h2>

<p>A really neat feature of IE8 is a built in "compatibility button", which essentially means if a website is not working correctly in IE8 you can run it as if it was IE7.</p>

<h2>Rendering</h2>
<p>I love how it renders my pages, IE8 seems to render exactly the same as FF3.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-90 aligncenter" title="similar_rendering" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/01/similar_rendering.png" alt="similar_rendering" width="640" height="495" /></p>

<p>There still seems to be some different padding/margin differences, but maybe something to look forward to in IE9?</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>I'm a firefox fanboy at ther end of the day, so i will not be moving to IE8. However, I will have it installed and I may use it from time to time :)</p>
