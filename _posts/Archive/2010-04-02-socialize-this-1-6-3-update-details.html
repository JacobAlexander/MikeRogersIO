<p>I am currently working on finishing Socialize This 1.6.3, it's due to be finished on the 6th of April 2010, though I expect I will update it into the Wordpress Repository on the 7th of April. Here is what I currently expect to be in it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bit.ly Support - I decided to pull it out of 1.6.2 because I was rushed to get an update out and working correctly. It has now been added.</li>
	<li>Small UI tweaks - Little things like hiding unnecessary elements in the page has been added. I've also added Twitter/bit.ly credential verification. </li>
	<li><a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> is now the default URL shortening service - This modification will only affect new installations of socialize this. I decided to change from<a href="http://tr.im/"> tr.im</a> because <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/08/18/url-shortener-speed-and-reliability-shootout/">is.gd appears to offer a faster and more reliable service</a>. </li>
	<li>I've started work on a API my end so users of Socialize This can easily see when new social widget sets are available and easily install them. However, that is a feature for v1.6.4. For now I've added a simple important announcements notification system. <br />
Encase you’re wondering, the API access can be disabled on the “Advanced Functions/Settings” page.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to note that from this version (1.6.3) on, I have discontinued Socialize This support for PHP4. For now PHP4 users will be offered a cut down version of v1.6.3.</p>
