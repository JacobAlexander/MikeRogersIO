<p>Some of you may have noticed there was a glitch on googles search results this morning which lead to all results being marked as harmful. Here is a screenshot I found:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="View 'Picture 1' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58365198@N00/3241515040"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/3241515040_b7c80dd5fe.jpg" border="0" alt="Picture 1" width="500" height="267" /></a></p>

<p>A google spokesman told <a title="bbc news website" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7862840.stm" target="_blank">BBC news</a>:
<blockquote>There was a fault. We don't know the nature of it yet. Everything has been solved. We are still making initial enquiries.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'll keep you informed as this story develops.</p>

<p>*Edit*</p>

<p>I just saw on <a title="Mashable" href="http://mashable.com/2009/01/31/google-blames-human-error-for-wordlwide-malware-alert/" target="_blank">Mashable</a> &amp; the <a title="Official Google Blog" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-your-computer-on.html">Official Google Blog</a> that the error was due to "human error".</p>
