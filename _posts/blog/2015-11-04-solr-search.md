Adding a custom search to your website can be somewhat tricky if you want to organise results by relavancy, solr can make this a bit easier.

## How to setup

Examples how adding in the search

## Setup for more scale

Solr defaults are setup for you to get going as fast as your can, but you may find you're reindexing a document to often

* Don't reindex every save, my approach
* Reindex in background
