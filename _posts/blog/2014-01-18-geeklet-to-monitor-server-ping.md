I've been using [Geektool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) for a while now, it's a super handy way to display useful information on my desktop. One geeklet I've found to be useful displays the status and ping of my VPS.

## Geeklet code
Here is the code you need to stick in the command box.

{% gist 8492860 uptime-monitor.sh %}

To modify the websites being pinged, just edit the $servers array on line 4.
