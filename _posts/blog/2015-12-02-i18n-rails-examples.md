For ages I had never fully embraced how time saving the i18n is in Rails. IMO it's one of its strongest features currently.

## How i18n decides on the language to use

Looks at what the browser is requesting (The lang header), if not found it'll fallback to the default.

## Where rails will do its magic to save you time

Labels, attributes, models, placeholders and when you call it directly.

## Lets imporve a form

```
Some shitty form with no i18n
```

### The better version

```

```

### The en.yml
