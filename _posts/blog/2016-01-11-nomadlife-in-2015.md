At the start of 2015 I discovered the concept of a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), the idea being that if you have an internet connection you can work from anywhere. 
The mixing of travel and work made a lot of sense to me, as it offered a stable income with a dash of adventure. 

## Getting Started

Before I packed my bags & said farewell forever to everyone I knew, I lurked online, reading up on the best places to go and what I'd need. 
I started with [#nomads](https://hashtagnomads.com/), a slack community of other digital nomads. I also followed other nomads on Twitter like [James Seymour-Lock](https://twitter.com/JamesSLock) and [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio). I also found a bunch of [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Digital%20Nomad), these were all full of helpful people. 

One of the big take aways I learnt from current nomads is to not just get up and leave [without anything to come back to](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/683106214536962048) on a year old adventure. Instead I should start with small trips and see how remote working feels (common sense right!).

Next I needed to figure out what I wanted to bring with me on my adventures & I accidently tidied most of the stuff I own into 8 cardboard boxes. 

Finally I attended a bunch of meetups in London, to find out what Digital Nomad folks are actually like. Turns out they are just like everyone else, but have awesome traveling stories.

## Hitting the road

My bag packed and I had MacBook Pro under my arm, I was set to go. In my mind I was like [Christopher McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McCandless), about to venture into the wild. 
In reality I was just going to other city (A 1 hour flight away) for 2 and a bit weeks with a lovely AirBnB booked.

### Berlin

Brilliant tech scene, lovely co-working space 

### Stockholm

Supirisingly fun city, ABBA & really friendly co-working space ( Fika )

### Prague

Amazing co-working space, very affordable city.

### Tarfia

Amazing people, and I tried kite surfing and regular surfing. I also broke my glasses.

### Gibraltar

Weird, expensive but most fun accomidation i've had to date.

## Has it changed me?

I'm much happier, I made a lot more friends and I reconnected with a lot of my old friends.

## What next?

- I loved meeting other developers 
- More travel, flights are super cheap
- I still can't quite fit everything into hand luaguage (joys of wearing contacts all day means I have to bring my cleaning fluids with me)
