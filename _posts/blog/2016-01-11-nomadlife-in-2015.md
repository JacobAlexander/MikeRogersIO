Maybe < "I always woundered what happened to the suitcase George Bailey was given in It's a wonderful life", but it might sound like a load of tosh.

One of my biggest fears in life is to end up like George Bailey from [It's a Wonderful Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/), where I end up never leaving the small town I grew up in and never see the world.

At the start of 2015 I discovered the concept of a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), the idea being that if you have an internet connection you can work from anywhere. 
The mixing of travel and work made a lot of sense to me, as it offered a source of income with a dash of adventure. 

## Getting Started

Before I packed my bags & said farewell forever to everyone I knew, I lurked online, reading up on the best places to go and what I'd need. 
I started with [#nomads](https://hashtagnomads.com/), a slack community of other digital nomads. I also followed other nomads on Twitter like [James Seymour-Lock](https://twitter.com/JamesSLock) and [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio). I also found a bunch of [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Digital%20Nomad), these were all full of helpful people. 

One of the big take aways I learnt from current nomads is to not just get up and leave [without anything to come back to](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/683106214536962048) on a year old adventure. Instead I should start with small trips and see how remote working feels (common sense right!).

Next I needed to figure out what I wanted to bring with me on my adventures & I accidently tidied most of the stuff I own into 8 cardboard boxes. 

Finally I attended a bunch of meetups in London, to find out what Digital Nomad folks are actually like. Turns out they are just like everyone else, but have awesome traveling stories.

## Hitting the road

My bag was packed and I had a MacBook Pro under my arm, I was set to go. In my mind I was like [Christopher McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McCandless), about to venture into the wild. 
In reality I was just going to other city (A 1 hour flight away, still within the EU) for 2 and a bit weeks with a lovely AirBnB booked. But still, dipping your feet to check the water is the first step in going for a swim.

### Berlin

{% img /uploads/2016/01/14/chaos-computer-club.jpg 600x800 "I found the chaos computer club" %}

I had visited Berlin before while Interrailing in 2013, I remembered leaving the city feeling like I had only scratched the surface of what it had to offer. I was totally right!

Working from Berlin (Instead of solely doing tourist stuff) offered a totally different perspective of the city. I was able to work and become friends with a few Berliners, and this made exploring Berlin that bit more fun.

I stayed in Kreuzberg (Near [Kottbusser Tor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ILpaR_I9pw&feature=youtu.be&t=39s)), which was near a the co-working space [co.up](http://co-up.de/). I really liked co.up because they hosted a bunch of events during the week in their office (Such as [Berlin.JS](http://berlinjs.org/) & [CodingAmigos](http://www.meetup.com/CodingAmigos/). Having something to go to in the evening really helped when I was initally feeling on my own in a new city.

### Stockholm

{% img /uploads/2016/01/14/inside-the-castle.jpg 576x1024 "Co-working from inside a castle" %}

I didn't know what to expect from Stockholm. I was told before leaving that Stockholm was an dull, unfriendly & expensive city. I think these were just a [sterotype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSLXjsqmXg) spread by people who don't want Stockholm to become overcrowded.

Stockholm had a lot of interesting things to see and do (Like [the Vasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship) & [Abba The Museum](http://www.abbathemuseum.com/)), but as a city they've also embraced [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=true&radius=5&userFreeform=Stockholm%2C+Sweden). Most days I'd be able to find something different to do in the that day or the evening & from that I met a bunch of really interesting people.

I settled into the co-working spaces in Stockholm really quickly. One of the main contributers to this was concept of [Fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(culture)) in Swedish culture, where you sit down and have a cinnamon buns with coffee while talking to each other. This helped break the ice & made for a really warm & welcoming atmosphere where ever I went.

Stockholm (like most of the nordic countries) is a tad on the expensive side, however generally the quality of everything is much higher. In my eyes paying the little bit extra was always a reasonable trade off.

My two favourite co-working spaces where, [The Castle](https://www.facebook.com/thecastlesthlm) (Where the photo above was taken) & [Guerilla Office](http://www.meetup.com/Guerilla-Office/) (A popup co-working group who meet in cafes).

### Prague

Prague is the perfect city for remote working in my opinion, it has a low cost of living and offers a very good quality of living for what you're paying. Also the metro system makes travel around the city super easy.

I didn't manage to try all the co-working spaces in Prague (There are way to many to choose from), I did manage to try a few though. 
My favourite (That also happened to be a 5 minute walk from the accommodation) was [Locus Workspace](http://en.locusworkspace.cz/). It was a nice mix of members & the staff organised lots of small events (After work talks, shared biscuit & coffee breaks etc) to help make sure everyone chatted to each other. 

Prague was also full of suprises, one of my favourites I was when a really loud annoucement in Czech came from outside then was followed by a really loud Siren. Everyone in the office just ignored it and kept working and I was quietly woundering if this would be my last commit before I start playing fallout in real life. Turns out there is a [Siren Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbrmSrlEwtk) the first wednesday of every month.

Wifi was avilable is most locations in Prague so I didn't eat to much data. At one point I did run out of clean clothes and ended up working from a Laundromat with 50mb/s internet for a few hours.

Unfortunally Meetup isn't very popular in Prague, but I attended a few really well organised CouchSurfing events which turned out to be a really fun way of meeting more people.


### Tarfia

{% img /uploads/2016/01/14/working-at-beach.jpg 600x450 "Working from a cafe next to a beach" %}

Tarfia is a small town at the southern tip of Spain, it's mostly known as one of the [most popular kite surfing locations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitesurfing_locations#Spain) in the world. This was my first time working outside of a big city, so it was a fairly special experience. Being able to work from a Cafe with an amazing beacn view, then the next day learning how to Kite Surf as a very unforgettable experience (and I made sure to let friends stuck in an office know about it). 

One of the cool experiences in Tarfia was working from a [co-working hostel](https://www.facebook.com/lacocotera.tarifa?fref=ts), I was staying in an AirBnB at the time but it was a really friendly enviroment. Going forward I'm definitly going to try and make more use of co-working hostel spaces!

I was also quite lucky in my timing when visiting Tarfia because I got there just before the [Nomad Cruise](http://www.nomadcruise.com/) was departing from the area. 
As a result I met a bunch of other remote workers, who really opened my eyes to how I could get more out of traveling while working. 

### Gibraltar

{% img /uploads/2016/01/14/yacht.jpg 599x337 "The yacht I was staying on" %}

I was only in Gibraltar for a few days but was such a weird, but worth visiting place, especially if you're a British. It's best described as a small exaggerated version of the UK, with monkeys. I was only staying for a few days, but the history and setup of the country was very interesting.

I got really lucky with my accomidation, as I was staying in the marina on a 50ft Yacht! This was my first time staying on a yacht and it was by far one of my favourite AirBnB experiences. 

## What next?

Everywhere I went I really enjoyed meeting other people, one of my fondest memories was attending my first hack night (where everyone can show off and get help with their current projects). I'd definitly want to keep that up.

Flights are currently super cheap (aviation fuel is cheap), so it makes sense to keep traveling while I can. That being said, I'd love to settle down in a city for a few months and put down a few roots.

Where ever I go, I don't want to buy a return ticket. One of the main lessons of learnt in the last 6 months is having a fixed return date stops you want to say "That other city sounds more fun, I'll go there" or "This place is awesome, I should stay another few weeks".
