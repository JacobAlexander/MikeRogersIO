One of my biggest fears in life is to end up like George Bailey in [It's a Wonderful Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/), where I end up never leaving the small town I grew up in and never see the world.

At the start of 2015 I discovered the concept of a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), the idea being that if you have an internet connection you can work from anywhere. 
The mixing of travel and work made a lot of sense to me, as it offered a source of income with a dash of adventure. 

## Getting Started

Before I packed my bags & said farewell forever to everyone I knew, I lurked online, reading up on the best places to go and what I'd need. 
I started with [#nomads](https://hashtagnomads.com/), a slack community of other digital nomads. I also followed other nomads on Twitter like [James Seymour-Lock](https://twitter.com/JamesSLock) and [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio). I also found a bunch of [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Digital%20Nomad), these were all full of helpful people. 

One of the big take aways I learnt from current nomads is to not just get up and leave [without anything to come back to](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/683106214536962048) on a year old adventure. Instead I should start with small trips and see how remote working feels (common sense right!).

Next I needed to figure out what I wanted to bring with me on my adventures & I accidently tidied most of the stuff I own into 8 cardboard boxes. 

Finally I attended a bunch of meetups in London, to find out what Digital Nomad folks are actually like. Turns out they are just like everyone else, but have awesome traveling stories.

## Hitting the road

My bag was packed and I had a MacBook Pro under my arm, I was set to go. In my mind I was like [Christopher McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McCandless), about to venture into the wild. 
In reality I was just going to other city (A 1 hour flight away, still within the EU) for 2 and a bit weeks with a lovely AirBnB booked. But still, dipping your feet to check the water is the first step in going for a swim.

### Berlin

I had visited Berlin before while Interrailing in 2013, I remembered leaving the city feeling like I had only scratched the surface of what it had to offer. I was totally right!

Working from Berlin (Instead of solely doing tourist stuff) offered a totally different perspective of the city. I was able to work and become friends with a few Berliners, and this made exploring Berlin that bit more fun.

I stayed in Kreuzberg (Near [Kottbusser Tor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ILpaR_I9pw&feature=youtu.be&t=39s)), which was near a the co-working space [co.up](http://co-up.de/). I really liked co.up because they hosted a bunch of events during the week in their office (Such as [Berlin.JS](http://berlinjs.org/) & [CodingAmigos](http://www.meetup.com/CodingAmigos/). Having something to go to in the evening really helped when I was initally feeling on my own in a new city.

### Stockholm

[The castle]

I didn't know what to expect from Stockholm. I was told before leaving that Stockholm was an dull, unfriendly & expensive city. I think these were just a sterotype spread by people who don't want Stockholm to become overcrowded.

Stockholm had a lot of interesting things to see and do (Like [the Vasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship) & [Abba The Museum](http://www.abbathemuseum.com/)), but as a city they've also embraced [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=true&radius=5&userFreeform=Stockholm%2C+Sweden). Most days I'd be able to find something different to do in the that day or the evening & from that I met a bunch of really interesting people.

I settled into the co-working spaces in Stockholm really quickly. One of the main contributers to this was concept of [Fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(culture)) in Swedish culture, where you sit down and have a cinnamon buns with coffee while talking to each other. This helped break the ice & made for a really warm & welcoming atmosphere where ever I went.

My two favourite co-working spaces where, [The Castle](https://www.facebook.com/thecastlesthlm) (Where the photo above was taken) & [Guerilla Office](http://www.meetup.com/Guerilla-Office/) (A popup co-working group who meet in cafes).

### Prague

Prague is super affordable to work from & has really top notch internet speeds.

Amazing co-working space, very affordable city. I had to do my own washing & felt like this gif.

### Tarfia

[Pic of me working at beach]

Amazing people, and I tried kite surfing and regular surfing. I meetup with an old buddy who could work for cafes (I struggles with that) I also broke my glasses.

### Gibraltar

[The yacht]

Weird, expensive but most fun accomidation i've had to date.

## Has it changed me?

I'm much happier, I made a lot more friends and I reconnected with a lot of my old friends.

## What next?

- I loved meeting other developers, I'll keep doing that.
- More travel, flights are super cheap. I might go outside of the EU but there is still so much to see
- I don't want to plan super far ahead. 
- I still can't quite fit everything into hand luaguage (joys of wearing contacts all day means I have to bring my cleaning fluids with me)
