Yesterday I pushed my new chrome extension [JustDelete.me to the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/justdeleteme/hfpofkfbabpbbmchmiekfnlcgaedbgcf). It's pretty exciting as it managed to achieve a fairly decent amount of installs on it's first day.

## What It Does
The extension takes data from my friends [Robb Lewis](http://robblewis.me/) and [Ed Poole](http://edpoole.me/) site [JustDelete.me](http://justdelete.me/), then with that data adds a traffic light indicator to the omnibar indicating how difficult it is to remove your account on a site.  

Plus if you click the icon, it'll open the page where you can request your account be deleted.

## Did I mention it's on Github?
As the JustDelete.me website has hosted all their code publicly on GitHub I decided it would be fitting to do the same. You can contribute and critique the extension on the repo [I made for it](https://github.com/MikeRogers0/justdelete.me-chrome-extension).

## Does it stick?
I'm watching the download and install stats pretty closely, if it looks like people are using it I'll work on creating a Firefox and Safari version.
