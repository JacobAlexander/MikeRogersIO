Back in 2011 when I was working as Junior Developer I launched [LivePage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh?hl=en), a small chrome extension to help me develop the front end of websites.

LivePage wasn't my first open source project, it is one of the few that I've quietly keeping tended to and maintaining. At the end of June 2016 (When LivePage was fast approaching 5 years old), LivePage had just over 26,000 Daily Active Users (DAU). This is fantastic!

Unfortunally to keep maintaining LivePage in a manor I'd expect from any piece of software, I feel the best option is to start charging a small yearly (£2.99) fee for it.

## Why charge for it?

I am currently in my 2nd year of freelancing full time, one of the lessons I've learnt in the last year is that I have to prioritise compensated work, otherwise my cashflow quickly becomes unstable which will snowball any levels of stress.

In the last few months LivePage is slowly taking up quite a bit of my personal time. The main bulk of this time is simply answering emails, the majority of which are just a matter of helping developers with their setup or clarifying exactly what LivePage does. I'm happy to help other developers, but currently providing support has failed to provide any financial or tangible compenstation.

I also want to improve the extension, some of the things I can do this myself assuming I can find the time. That said, if LivePage is making money then I can easily justify hiring someone who specialises in what needs to be done, which will be even better for the end users.

## Why not sell it outright?

Every other month or so, I do receive a request to sell LivePage outright (Normally offering $0.10 per DAU). A quick search normally suggests the buyer simply wants to [inject adware to the extension](http://www.labnol.org/internet/sold-chrome-extension/28377/). I am 100% against exposing users who have trusted me to that level of douchebaggery.


## What will happen next

It'll still stay open source, though I've updated the lisence to be AGPL. Basically you're allowed to poke around the code & make changes, but you can't redistribute. I think this is a fair trade off.

I have plans to improve the extension. My main priority is to add clearer copy and expand the internationalisation, as I feel this will help LivePage reach a bigger audience. If possible I'd love to be able ot pay copyrighters and translaters to do a fantastic job & really make LivePage as friendly as possible. Furthermore I'd love to add a test suite around LivePage's functionality (when I first wrote it I knew nothing about testing), while I can do this myself I need to justify the time it'll take.

Lastly, in 3 months time (October 2016) I'm going to publish a follow up on how successful switching to a subscription model was. I'm going to be completly transparent on the effect on DAU numbers and how many users have subscribed to the extension.

## Caveats & Sidenotes

There are very few other extensions for sale in the chrome store, I think a lot of this comes down to the nature of the extensions & Google not supporting sales in all regions. If lack of avialablity proves to be an issue, I will look at alternative methods of distibution, such a direct sales (Like [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) does). If you are unable to buy a copy, please contact me & I'll try my best to help.

If the subscription model fails to take off, I will attempt other methods of monetisation such as single payment or requesting donations.

All current users of LivePage will not have to pay, only new users. I've also setup the chrome web store to allow a 30 day free trial. It's also only £2.99 a year, which I think it's a reasonable amount of ask.
