<p>Good News Everyone! I have finally got around to delivering a new wordpress plugin, creatively named "<a title="WP HTML5 Category Selector @ Wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-html5-category-selector/">WP HTML5 Category Selector</a>".</p>

<p>In a nutshell the <a title="WP HTML5 Category Selector @ Wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-html5-category-selector/">WP HTML5 Category Selector</a> adds a filter input field to the category box on the add/edit post page. It's primarily aimed at bloggers who have lots (for example more then 10) of categories.</p>

<p>If you have a chance to give it a try, I would love to hear you feedback (On twitter I'm <a title="MikeRogers0's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#MikeRogers0">@MikeRogers0</a>).</p>
