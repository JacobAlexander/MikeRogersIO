<p>Zebra Stripping is the technique of having different colours per each line on a list. It generally is considered to help users read large tables of information; however there is <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zebrastripingdoesithelp/">evidence suggesting the effectiveness of zebra stripes is somewhat overrated</a>. Having said that, in CSS3 it's very easy to implement so it's worthwhile adding.</p>
<p>To add Zebra Strips to a list, all you need to do is adding the followingÂ pseudo-class to the end of the CSS element you wish to edit:</p>

<p>In this example, I've used an unordered list element. The data in the brackets refers to the "nth" number to affect, for example putting "(even)" will affect every even &lt;li&gt;. You can also put number in, for example "(3)" would affect every 3rd &lt;li&gt;.</p>
<p>Below is a link to a working example of the code in action (Feel free to copy &amp; share).</p>
