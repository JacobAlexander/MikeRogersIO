<p>It's now  a lot faster at showing the icons and overall the backend performance is also better.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Key Changes</h2>
<p>Firstly, when you check the plugin page instead of showing you the settings, it now shows you a list of your most Socialized posts/pages.</p>
<p>The settings page has also had a little overhaul. I worked really hard to simply settings up some of Socialize This' features, for example the Twitter integration now uses OAuth which means you no longer need to input your Twitter details, you just have to click a link and the plugin should do the rest.</p>
<p><a class="floatright" href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/06/screenshot-22.png"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-1492" title="screenshot-2" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/06/screenshot-22-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The Widgets management has also been changed significantly. One of the big changes is that you now have real life previews of the widgets. I have have added the functionality for you to add your own widgets into the plugin via a neat form.</p>
<p>The Widget Set XML files have also been updated - If you are using your own social icon set you will need to update to the newer XML layout.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of the biggest changes is the way the widgets are displayed. They are now returned in a list  and I have included a CSS file which should format them nicely (Though it can be disabled on the "Advanced Functions/Settings" page.</p>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<p><a class="floatright" href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/06/screenshot-4.png"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-1494" title="screenshot-4" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/06/screenshot-4-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the big structural changes to the Socialize This back end when you upgrade you will lose a good deal of the previous data (I'm sorry!) . Namely the active widgets you have selected/added. So you will need to update your settings.</p>
<p>Automatic update should be mostly headache free, however I recommend deactivating Socialize This, deleting it and then uploading and installing the new version (Though, it's totally optional).</p>
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>Thank you for giving <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/socialize-this">Socialize This 2.0.0</a> a try. I'm currently overhauling the <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/socialize-this/faq">FAQ</a> section (Hopefully - I'll have time to make a few video tutorials), if you have time make sure you give it the quick once over.</p>
