<p>A few months ago 3 Google employees explored an innovative approach to CAPTCHA (<a href="http://www.richgossweiler.com/projects/rotcaptcha/rotcaptcha.pdf">Whatâ€™s Up CAPTCHA? A CAPTCHA Based On Image Orientation</a>). Essentially they suggested that having a user orientate an image into its upright position is easier for users (typing difficult to read text can be problematic) and harder for computers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/CAPTCHA_Based_On_Image_Orientation/26463.png" alt="Computers find it hard to figure out what this is" /><br />
 <em>A computer finds it really difficult to know if this is correctly orientated.</em></p>

<p>Here is a version I wrote which to can use on your website.</p>

<p><a class="view_demo" title="CAPTCHA Based On Image Orientation Demo" href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/CAPTCHA_Based_On_Image_Orientation/CAPTCHA_Based_On_Image_Orientation.php" target="_blank">View Demo</a> <a class="download" href="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/06/captcha_based_on_image_orientation.zip">Download</a></p>

<p>This script makes use of jQuery to allow the user to rotate the images and a little PHP to check the image was rotated into the correct position.</p>
