I've just finished typing out the last few lines of code for LivePage 1.3, and it's pretty slick. As side from adding a few of the requested features, I also tidied up the code a little &amp; made a few performance tweaks.

You can download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh">LivePage from the Chrome web store</a> (free of course). Some of it's key new features have been described a bit more below.

<h2>Less</h2>
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> is my favourite CSS preprocessing tool. So I want to introduce as many people to it as possible. So LivePage will now monitor LESS files on the page for changes &amp; load their changes without a page refresh.

LivePage 1.3 currently ships with LESS version 1.3.0, as new versions are released I'll updated LivePage and push out an update after testing. By default LivePage will monitor for LESS style sheets.
<h2>Entire domains can be live</h2>
One of the original feature I pulled until I could perfect the implementing was making entire domains "live". So say your developing on the domain example.local, and you click to LivePage button, every page being served from example.local will be live.

This feature is off by default as I didn't want to have a major UX change for current users of LivePage.
<h2>file://</h2>
Supporting the file:// protocol was a tad tricky, as a result LivePage needs an extra permission. But it's worth it to be able to quickly drag and drop files into your browser and start editing them in real time.

To use this feature make sure on the extension page (chrome://chrome/extensions/), you have ticked "Allow access to file URLs " for the LivePage extension.
