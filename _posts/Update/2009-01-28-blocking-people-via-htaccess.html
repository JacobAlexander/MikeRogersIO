<p>Every website has problems with users . Here is a cool way to ban users who prove to be annoying.</p>
<p>Open your .htaccess file (should be above your public_html folder and you may need to show hidden files), then add the following:</p>

{% gist 2907470 deny-from-ip %}

<p>If you want to add more than one IP, just add an extra "deny from [ip here]" line. On the other hand, if you want to just let one person onto a website just use the following:</p>

{% gist 2907470 allow-from-ip %}

<p>Allowing just a few IP's to certain areas is useful when protecting administrator sections or user areas.</p>
