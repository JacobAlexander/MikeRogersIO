<p>Building a website is not difficulty, but making it look perfect in very browser is almost impossible.  Here are a few essential tools to make cross browser testing a little easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage">IETester</a> - Internet Explorer is a pain to build a website on, mainly because standalone versions are difficult to run on Windows Vista and Mac. This little tool makes testing your website on multiple versions of Internet Explorer a breeze.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="IETester" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2009/08/ietester.png" alt="IETester" width="504" height="267" /></p>

<p>IETester allows you to compare you website in Internet Explorer Versions 5 to 8. Its interface is easy to understand and while there is still work needed to be done on it, I would be surprised not to see it on every web developer/designer's desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/">iPhoney</a> - Lots of users are now browsing the internet on their iPhone. It makes sense for webmasters to make sure their website works correctly on the small screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://browsershots.org/">BrowserShots</a> - BrowserShots is quite famous for allowing designers to see their websites is lots of browser (in the region of 93) on major OS's.  The main disadvantage though is that you have to wait over an hour to see the screen shots.</p>

<p><a href="http://meineipadresse.de/netrenderer/index.php">IE NetRender</a> - Similar to BrowerShots, in terms of a web based screen grab service. But this website does not require a wait of up to an hour to see a screen shot. However, it does only support Internet Explorer.</p>
