<p>The HTML5 canvas is a really neat new feature which allows you to draw shapes. It's a little unknown of how it will be implemented in the mainstream web, however current forecasts suggests it can create really cool games such as <a href="http://www.pirateslovedaisies.com/">Pirates Love Daisies</a>, applications such as <a href="http://mugtug.com/sketchpad/">Sketchpad</a> or even a new method of CAPTCHA.</p>

<p>Here is a quick cookbook on how to get started with Canvas where you will learn how to draw basic shapes and colours.</p>
<h2>Finding your Feet</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to start playing with the canvas tool is a browser which supports canvas. Currently most modern browsers do support canvas (This includes, IE9, Google Chrome and Firefox).</p>

<p>Next, set up the shell of your HTML5 page. To save you time I <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/Getting_Started_with_HTML5_Canvas/html5_canvas_start.html">have made a basic example</a><a></a> you can copy.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember about adding the canvas tag to your page is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Your page has the html5 doctype, otherwise it might not work.</li>
	<li>You add a width and height, otherwise your graphics may look cropped.</li>
	<li>You add a "Your browser does not support the  HTML5 notice" notice in the canvas tag for older browsers.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Making a Square</h2>

<p>Making a square is pretty simple; in a nutshell all you need to be able to do is understand how x/y coordinates work. I've <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/Getting_Started_with_HTML5_Canvas/html_canvas_square.html">uploaded this demo</a>.</p>

[code]// More canvas stuff  will go here.
context.moveTo(5, 10); // Move the start point to x = 5, y = 10
context.beginPath(); // Open the path i.e. Start drawing
context.lineTo(55, 10); // Draw the line to x = 55, y = 10 then continue
context.lineTo(55, 60);
context.lineTo(5, 60);
context.lineTo(5, 10);
context.closePath(); // Close the path, so that javascript knows the shape is done.
	
// Fill the shape.
context.fillStyle=&quot;#8ED6FF&quot;;
context.fill();
	
// Colour in the border of the shape.
context.strokeStyle=&quot;#0000ff&quot;;
context.stroke();[/code]

<h2>Building a Circle</h2>

Creating a circle is a little different, instead of just putting the x/y coordinates you also have to state the starting radius, ending radius and whether if you your arc to be anti-clockwise (Weird right?). Here <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/Getting_Started_with_HTML5_Canvas/html_canvas_circle.html">is the code example</a>.

[code]context.arc(100,75,50,0,Math.PI*2,true); // arc(x coordinate, y coordinate, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)[/code]
<h2>Rotating your Canvas</h2>

This is probably one of the most useful features for most web designers out there. Pretty much you can rotate the canvas. <a href="http://www.fullondesign.co.uk/examples/Getting_Started_with_HTML5_Canvas/html_canvas_rotating.html">Check out my example</a>.

[code]// Rotate the canvas 15%
context.rotate(0.15);[/code]
