<p>Create forms on a web page is relatively simple, however what most developers forget is the golden rule of usability, "Users are Idiots".Â  In a large number of websites they fail to provide a clear indication of how a form field needs to be formatted. Some even seem to even forget to clear the field when the user clicks into, which is really useful if your website has users with motor skills.</p>
<p>Here is a really neat piece of jQuery I use to make forms a little easier for users which takes little work to integrate (Just copy and paste before the </body> tag).</p>

<p>It takes the title of the field and places it into the value, then clears the value when the user clicks into it. It also takes the value of the label and places it into an information box, which can help explain what a user needs to do.</p>
