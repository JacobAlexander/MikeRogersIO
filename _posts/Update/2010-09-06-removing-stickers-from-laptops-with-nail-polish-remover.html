<p>AMD recently announced it will start using <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/amd-switching-to-easy-peel-off-laptop-stickers-2010092/">easy peel laptop stickers</a>, which is great news if your anything like me and can't stand having a new laptop being covered in "Windows Vista" or "If you need help, visit out website" rubbish. However, lots of stickers on laptops can be a pain to remove (and degrade over time).</p>
<p>The best way to remove stickers which aren't easy peel is nail polish remover (I used <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0034G5RHI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fulondes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0034G5RHI">Nails Inc Nail Polish Remover 250ml</a>). Here is the method I use:</p>

<h2>Step 1 - Wipe the remover over the stickers</h2>
<p>Grab your nail polish remover and put it on a piece of cotton (or kitchen paper). Then wipe the remover over and around the stickers. This should help lift the stickers up a little (Making them easier to peel off).</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Peal off the stickers</h2>
<p>Take off the stickers. Some metal stickers will leave a little extra glue (Don't worry, you can deal with this in step 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1579  aligncenter" title="IMAG0161" src="http://cdn.fullondesign.co.uk/uploads/2010/09/IMAG0161-179x300.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Step 3 - Clean up</h2>
<p>Odds are there will be a few glue marks where the stickers were. Just wipe a little more nail polish remover where the marks are and eventually all the marks should disappear.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will find this useful :)<br><em>Note: Make sure you don't use too much nail polish remover, as it can stain.</em></p>
