I opened my first ticket of the day & made a grimace look. The client I was working with had sent over design changes. The client was confident in changing things in the browser, and they'd send me annotated screenshots and snippets of code for what they wanted to change, but felt inefficient.

Then I was inspired, what if my clients who could edit in the browser and send me a much more complete summary. I started building and last week I launched the 1.0.0 version of my idea [TrackChanges](https://trackchanges.mikerogers.io/). 

## The first MVP

- Pretty naff right?
- I got a lukewarm response, but generally the idea resonated.

## Better inspiration

- Drinking with a buddy, he had the same problem. I vaguely described what I had built and asked what he needed.
- Home boy blew my mind a bit

## The landing page

- I got lucky, my friend built me something awesome.

## The final product
