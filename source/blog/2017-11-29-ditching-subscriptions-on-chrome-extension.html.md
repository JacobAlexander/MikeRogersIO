Just over a year ago I wrote [a post](/2016/10/29/lessons-learnt-from-monetising-my-chrome-extension.html) detailing my experiences selling [LivePage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh/details) https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh/details Google Chrome Extension via a subscription model. It has been a pretty exciting year since I wrote that, and I wanted to write a follow up article.

## Ditching Subscription

After I wrote the initial article, I was pretty confident that asking $2 or so a year was the right way to go. I couldn't have been more wrong.

One of the big feedback points I received from the comments on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12925467) was that I should make it a one off payment. So I experimented! Before when I had subscriptions I'd earn about ~£140 a month, during the month I switched to one off payment I earned a total of £200. Clearly the one off payment was the more popular choice.

Sticking with annual subscriptions for so long really came back to bite me when they started renewing. I didn't add any mechanism to warn users they were about to be charged, and I ended up receiving a lot of emails from annoyed users requesting refunds. I provided all subscribers who messaged me with a refund as quickly as I could, but it sucked.

I decided to sift through the subscription data I had available to make a decision on what to do next, I discovered:

1. Approximately ~40% of users had cancelled their subscription within a week of purchase
2. 50% of the remaining subscribers would email me when their subscription renewed

I decided the only sensible things to do was cancel out the remaining subscriptions. Ultimately I didn't want to spend my evenings refunding unhappy peoples money, when I could be focusing on new users.

Over the last year I've earned a total of £2,532 (An average of £211 a month). This has been awesome! While this doesn't quite cover my rent, it does allow me to happily provide support & do a few days of maintenance a month.

## Experimenting with Adwords

Kind of not worth it.

## Support is reasonable

- People are insane.

## Chrome Store is still imperfect

## A year later

I earned a bit more money, users are dropping but I'm not worried

## What is next, Firefox?

Also I have a new extension you might enjoy!
