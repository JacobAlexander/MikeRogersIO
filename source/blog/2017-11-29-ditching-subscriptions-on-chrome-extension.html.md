Just over a year ago I wrote [a post](/2016/10/29/lessons-learnt-from-monetising-my-chrome-extension.html) detailing my experiences monetising [LivePage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh/details) Google Chrome Extension via a subscription model. It has been a pretty exciting year since I wrote that, and I wanted to write a follow up article.

## Ditching Subscription

After I wrote the initial article, I was pretty confident that asking $2 or so a year was the right way to go. I couldn't have been more wrong.

One of the big feedback points I received from the comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12925467) was that I should make it a one off payment. So I experimented! Before when I had subscriptions I'd earn about ~£140 a month, during the month I switched to one off payment I earned a total of £200. Clearly the one off payment was the more popular choice.

Sticking with annual subscriptions for so long really came back to bite me when they started renewing. I didn't add any mechanism to warn users they were about to be charged, and I ended up receiving a lot of emails from annoyed users requesting refunds. I provided all subscribers who messaged me with a refund as quickly as I could, but it sucked.

I decided to sift through the subscription data I had available to make a decision on what to do next, I discovered:

1. Approximately ~40% of users had cancelled their subscription within a week of purchase
2. 50% of the remaining subscribers would email me when their subscription renewed

I decided the only sensible things to do was cancel out the remaining subscriptions. Ultimately I didn't want to spend my evenings refunding unhappy peoples money, when I could be focusing on new users.

Over the last year I've earned a total of £2,532 (An average of £211 a month). This has been awesome! While this doesn't quite cover my rent, it does allow me to happily provide support & do a few days of maintenance a month.

## Support is an adventure

Supporting an extension which I initially wrote when I was a junior developer has been an experience. Development wise I try to clean as I go, which works nicely.

Users on the other hand, users continually manage to surprise me! I used to assume everyone who used LivePage was a front end developer who is using SASS and had a local development environment. This is almost never the case. I've had users get in touch with me are working with unprocessed CSS, and working in production via FTP. Others aren't even using it to build websites, they just want a webpage to be refreshed when it changes.

Proving support can feel a little disheartening at times as well (especially when a customer is unhappy), but at most it takes an hour of my time a week, so I'm happy to keep doing it myself.

## Chrome Store is still imperfect

The Google Chrome Store feels very much the same as it did a year ago. 

I had a few spikes up to 140k users, reviews are tricky to respond to in a timely manor. 

## What is next, Firefox?

I earned a bit more money, users are dropping but I'm not worried

Also I have a new extension you might enjoy!
