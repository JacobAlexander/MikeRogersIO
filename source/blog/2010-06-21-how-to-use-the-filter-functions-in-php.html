<p>When I started learning PHP (Back in the PHP4 days) validating data was always a pain (for me at least). Most of the resources available cited the <a href="http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/ref.regex.php">POSIX functions</a> as the most effective way of validating an email address or URL.</p>
<p>Thankfully since then, the PHP community has embraced the <a href="http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcre.php">PCRE functions</a> which are more efficient and are Perl-compatible. However the downside to PCRE (and POSIX for that matter) is that you need to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>, which for a newbie to learn can feel like walking through a minefield.</p>
<p>Recently though the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.filter.php">Filter Functions</a> have become a very popular method to validate data. This is due to their small learning curve.</p>

<h2>How to use the Filter Functions</h2>
<p>In this example (Using the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php">filter_var()</a> function) the filter function takes the data you input (For example: email@example.com) and will return either the data (if it's valid) or false (if the data is not valid).</p>

<p>A handful of the useful <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.php">available filters</a> are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING - Removes HTML tags and possibly unwanted characters.</li>
  <li>FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL - Removes unwanted characters from an email address.</li>
  <li>FILTER_SANITIZE_URL - Removes unwanted characters from a URL.</li>
  <li>FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT - Returns only digits,  + and -.</li>
  <li>FILTER_VALIDATE_INT - If data is not an integer it will return false.</li>
  <li>FILTER_VALIDATE_URL - If data is not a URL it will return false.</li>
  <li>FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL - If data is not an email it will return false.</li>
  <li>FILTER_VALIDATE_IP- If data is not an IP it will return false.</li>
</ul>
